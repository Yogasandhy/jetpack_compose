           "Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. It is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.",
           "JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to add interactivity to web pages. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming with platforms such as Node.js. JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich and first appeared in 1995.",
           "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications and is popular for developing Android apps. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) and first appeared in 1995.",
           "Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language developed by Apple for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It is designed to be easy to learn and use and includes modern features such as type safety, optionals, and closures. Swift was developed by Chris Lattner and many others at Apple Inc. and first appeared in 2014.",
           "PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development. It can be embedded into HTML to add server-side functionality to web pages and is widely used to create dynamic content and interact with databases. PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf and first appeared in 1995.",
           "C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms. It was originally designed as an extension to the C programming language and is widely used for system and application programming due to its efficiency and flexibility. C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs and first appeared in 1985.",
           "C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. It is widely used for building Windows desktop applications and games, as well as web and mobile applications. C# was developed by Microsoft, led by Anders Hejlsberg, and first appeared in 2000.",
           "Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source programming language developed by Google that aims to provide the efficiency of a statically-typed compiled language with the ease of use of a dynamically-typed interpreted language. It has built-in support for concurrency and is often used for building scalable network services. Go was created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google and first appeared in 2009.",
           "Ruby is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that was designed to be easy to read and write. It has an elegant syntax that supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Ruby was created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and first appeared in 1995.",
           "SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It provides a standard way to insert, update, delete, and query data using commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc. SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s.",
